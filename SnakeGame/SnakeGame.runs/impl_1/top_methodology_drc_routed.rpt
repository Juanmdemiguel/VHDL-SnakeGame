TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock Inst_Clock_Manager/Inst_PLL/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin Inst_Clock_Manager/Inst_PLL/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): Inst_Clock_Manager/clk, clk_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Inst_GAME_Move/snake_move.snake_length_future_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Inst_GAME_Move/snake_move.snake_length_future_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 1 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
